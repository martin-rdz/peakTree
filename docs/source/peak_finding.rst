Peak finding
======================

The peak finding procedure is adapted to the peako [Kalesse_et_al_2019]_ parameters in v0.3.
Additional averaging in time and height can be set via ``t_avg`` and ``h_avg`` with the units of ``[s]`` and ``[m]``, respectively.
Smoothing along the velocity dimension can be done by 3 methods:

#. ``scipy.signal.savgol_filter`` by ``setting smooth_polyorder = 1`` (linear) or ``= 2`` (quadratic)
#. ``loess.loess_1d`` by ``setting smooth_polyorder = 11`` (linear) or ``= 12`` (quadratic)
#. convolution with a gauss function by ``setting smooth_polyorder = 21``

where the smoothing span is given by ``span`` in ``[m s-1]``.
The actual peak finding parameters are ``prom_thres`` in ``[dB]`` and ``width_thres`` in ``[m s-1]``.
